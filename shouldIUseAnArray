Calculator taking inputs as strings vs arrays

Arrays: 
Only works if there's just two values which would probably work for
this simple calculator. After summing two values their sum could
overwrite the first value in the array. And pressing an operator would
just select the function that the array items would be an input for. 

Does it make sense to always only have one value on the screen?

Should num1 and num2 default two 0? So if the first input is an 
operator, there would still always be answer.

Strings: 
By the time I got here I was pretty decided upon arrays.
